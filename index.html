    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p> I was born in America, and yet i consider myself Brazilian at heart. I was raised in Brazil and moved to the U.S. when i was about 6.
       The culture and traditions and foods I have come to love are all Brazilian. My family is too. I go to East Side High School and I am 16 years old.
       I don't know too much about coding, but I think I have begun to understand the ropes.
    </p>
